Implementation of Board, Player and Disks:

First, a structure was created for a single node that represents a position on the board. This structure contains a char and int that displays it's position to the user.
It also has a char that determines the disk on it e.g. W for white and B for black.
After that, a structure called Player was created which has a char array to store the players' names and int to store the score of the players.
Lastly, a board structure was created which contains a 2-D array of the Node struct and 2 objects of the Player struct.

Implementation of Game Logic:

Game logic is implemented in following way:
•	Accept player names.
•	Initialise the board and empty nodes.
•	Place two disks for each player.
•	Calculate score.
•	Print table.
•	Start loop.
•	Accept input from player.
•	Check input format.
•	Check valid points.
•	If valid points are available, then move, otherwise pass.
•	Repeat the steps for both players until both players have no valid moves left or the board is full.
•	Print results.
•	Save data to file.
